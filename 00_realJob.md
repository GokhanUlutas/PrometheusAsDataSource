Setting up Prometheus as a data source for Grafana using Helm in a Minikube environment within GitHub Codespaces can be structured as an **Objective and Key Results (OKRs)** framework to ensure clarity and measurable success.

### Objective:
**Deploy Prometheus and Grafana on Minikube in GitHub Codespaces using Helm, and configure Prometheus as a data source for Grafana.**

---

### Key Results (KR):

1. **Key Result 1**: **Install Helm on the GitHub Codespaces Environment**
   - Install Helm in the Codespaces development environment to manage Prometheus and Grafana deployments.
   - Verify Helm installation by running `helm version`.

   **Steps:**
   - Open your Codespaces terminal.
   - Install Helm:
     ```bash
     curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
     ```
   - Verify:
     ```bash
     helm version
     ```

2. **Key Result 2**: **Deploy Prometheus using Helm**
   - Use Helm to install the Prometheus chart on your Minikube cluster in Codespaces.
   - Ensure Prometheus is accessible via port forwarding or service endpoints.

   **Steps:**
   - Add the Prometheus community Helm repository:
     ```bash
     helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
     ```
   - Update Helm repositories:
     ```bash
     helm repo update
     ```
   - Install Prometheus:
     ```bash
     helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
     ```
   - Verify the Prometheus pods are running:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods
     ```
   - Set up port forwarding (for local Grafana to Prometheus):
     ```bash
     kubectl port-forward service/prometheus-server 9090:80
     ```

3. **Key Result 3**: **Deploy Grafana using Helm**
   - Install Grafana using Helm and confirm that itâ€™s running in the Minikube environment.
   - Make sure Grafana is accessible from the Codespaces or port forwarding.

   **Steps:**
   - Add the Grafana Helm repository:
     ```bash
     helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
     ```
   - Install Grafana:
     ```bash
     helm install grafana grafana/grafana
     ```
   - Confirm that Grafana is running:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods
     ```
   - Set up port forwarding for Grafana:
     ```bash
     kubectl port-forward service/grafana 3000:80
     ```

4. **Key Result 4**: **Configure Prometheus as a Data Source in Grafana**
   - Log into the Grafana UI and configure Prometheus as a data source.
   - Ensure successful data retrieval from Prometheus and display metrics on a Grafana dashboard.

   **Steps:**
   - Access Grafana at `http://localhost:3000` and log in with default credentials (`admin/admin`).
   - Navigate to **Configuration** > **Data Sources** > **Add data source**.
   - Select **Prometheus** from the list.
   - In the URL field, enter `http://prometheus-server` (or your Prometheus service URL).
   - Click **Save & Test** to ensure connectivity.

5. **Key Result 5**: **Create and Visualize a Grafana Dashboard**
   - Set up a basic Grafana dashboard that visualizes metrics from Prometheus.
   - Include key metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, and pod availability.

   **Steps:**
   - In Grafana, go to **Dashboards** > **New Dashboard**.
   - Add a new panel and select a Prometheus metric (e.g., `up`, `node_cpu_seconds_total`).
   - Configure the panel settings and visualization preferences.
   - Save the dashboard.

### Final OKR Summary:
- **Objective**: Deploy and integrate Prometheus as a data source for Grafana using Helm in a Minikube environment on GitHub Codespaces.
- **Key Results**: 
   - Install Helm in Codespaces.
   - Deploy Prometheus using Helm.
   - Deploy Grafana using Helm.
   - Configure Prometheus as a data source for Grafana.
   - Create a basic Grafana dashboard visualizing Prometheus metrics.

This structured OKR approach will help ensure that the Prometheus-Grafana setup is successful, traceable, and aligned with the deployment goals.
